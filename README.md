# SMRT_Neo4j
Welcome to the Singapore MRT Network Graph Database! This project models the Singapore Mass Rapid Transit (MRT) system using Neo4j, a leading graph database. The aim is to represent MRT stations, their connections across different lines, and the travel times between them. This structured representation facilitates advanced queries, route optimization, and insightful analyses of the MRT network.
